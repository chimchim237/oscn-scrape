# oscn-scrape
This doesn't work yet; I'm trying out new things until I can get something working. I'll try to document my progress at the [wiki](https://github.com/chimchim237/oscn-scrape/wiki). So that's where all documentation will be for now. When I've got a working prototype, this readme will describe how to use it.

UPDATE:
finally got something working after downloading a search from the OSCN site, on to a different location for testing purposes (http://tulsawebdesign.com/oscn/).  one of the tutorials that helped was [How To Scrape Web Pages with Beautiful Soup and Python 3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-scrape-web-pages-with-beautiful-soup-and-python-3)
