# oscn-scrape
This doesn't work yet; I'm trying out new things until I can get something working. I'll try to document my progress at the [wiki](https://github.com/chimchim237/oscn-scrape/wiki). So that's where all documentation will be for now. When I've got a working prototype, this readme will describe how to use it.
