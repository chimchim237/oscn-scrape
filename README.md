# oscn-scrape
This doesn't work yet; I'm trying out new things until I can get something working. I'll try to document my progress at the [wiki](https://github.com/chimchim237/oscn-scrape/wiki). So that's where all documentation will be for now. When I've got a working prototype, this readme will describe how to use it.

# UPDATE:
I've finally got something working after downloading a search from the OSCN site, on to a different location for testing purposes (http://tulsawebdesign.com/oscn/).  The reason for this, I think, is that OSCN has some security measures in place to deter DOS attacks and other scraping methods. I'll try to find a way to be respectful.
